# SIMON

## Game Description

Simon, a pop culture phenomenon of the 1970's and 80's, is a basic game of memory skill. It's invention is credited to Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, and it seeks to challenge players on their ability to remember a code that builds upon itself.

Inspired by my appreciation for Simon, I've recreated it to play as a browser game.

## Technologies Used

- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS

## Getting Started

Press the play button to begin. Then one of the buttons on the simon board will flash and make a sound. Use the visual flash and sounds to remember the sequence as it is played back to you. You will have to wait until the end of the sequence is played back for you to enter your matching sequence. Be careful, if you press the wrong button, you will be out!

## Next Steps

- Add accessibility mode for visual imparement.
- Add Simon Reverse mode, where the player must enter the pattern backwards.
